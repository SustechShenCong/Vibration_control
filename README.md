# SSM-VIB-CONTROL: Active vibration control of nonlinear flexible structures via reduction on spectral submanifolds

This repo provides the code implementation of the SSM-based control design framework proposed in [1]. Examples reported in [1] are also included in this repo.

## Dependencies
This repo is based on SSMTool 2.3

Given SSMTool is continuously developed, we plan to merge our development into the main branch of SSMTool in future.

## Getting Started
 * To get started, in Matlab run install.m
 * Go to examples/Vib_control folders and run demos.

## Example list
 * Two oscillators: two coupled nonlinear oscillators
 * OsillatorChain: an oscillator chain with 10 coupled nonlinear oscillators
 * von Karman beam: a clamped-pinned von Karman beam
 * von Karman shell: a shallow shell with and without internal resonance
 * Aircraft wing: a NACA wing model with more than 130,000 DOFs
 * Pipe conveying fluid: a cantilever pipe conveying fluid
